COLLABORATION PROCEDURES
TRANSIENT, UNDER DEVELOPMENT
BETWEEN CHRIS AND GREG
============================

If we had net access between your XP box and my
office, we could do this easily and in real time
by mapping a file here into each of our saneFORTH
systems.  The file would then be available to both
of our polyFORTH systems running on the EVBs, and
the connection could easily be secured using IPSec.
This is how we oldtimers usually work together; it
is as tight as can be.

Collaboration set-up:

1.  Make minimal file system on a USB flash using
    the XP machine.  Directory is D:\evb.  Copy
    one of my 4800 block CARTHEUR-back.src files
    into it.  Move flash to XP machine if this was
    done on another.
2.  On XP machine make projects\henry
    Duplicate of DEFAULT directory.
3.  Do all the replacements in file names, shortcut
    command line and custom.txt file content for
    the new directory name.
4.  Verify the shortcut works.  Say BYE.
5.  Change content of custom.txt so that 5 UNIT
    aka Projback in comment has the full path to
    the new file on the USB flash.
6.  Run aF-3 using same shortcut.
7.  DISKING LOAD  4800 QX  to see differences
    between the default application source and the
    "backup" as received from me.


HENRY HARDWARE DEBUG SETUP:

1.  EVB ports A and B connected and properly configured
    as per 
2.  Insert jumper J26.
3.  Fire up voltmeter, 10V scale good.
4.  Have DB014 EVB pinouts handy (p.26)
5.  Have DB013 section 5 (p.31) handy for reference on the external IDE. (REALLY READ THIS!)
6.  Have DB001 page 10 handy for F18 register addresses.
7.  Have DB002 2.3 page 10 handy for IO port addressing.

10007 CONTROLS d buses, 10009 CONTROLS a buses.

NEXT SESSION: EXECUTE - 3, 4, 6, 11, ... 

DEBUG HENRY HARDWARE:
1.  Insert J26 no-boot jumper.
2.  Check paths 0PA 1PA 2PA if you've been changing them
3.  Say BRIDGE LOAD  TALK  to connect to host chip
4.  Say SPAN  to append target chip to host
5.  Say 0 PATH  to select path which can reach target
6.  Say 0 10007 HOOK  to connect with node 7 on target,
    which controls 18 bit data bus via its UP register
7.  Say SEE  to display stack and RAM in that node
8.  Say 1. LIT  then 2. LIT  then 3. LIT  to push those
    numbers onto the node's stack and see display update
9.  Notice from DB002 that the parallel bus register is
    reached as UP.  It would be nice to read UP at this
    point, however read and write of UP blocks waits for
    signals from node 10008.  Use DATA instead.
10. To see what should be on the data pins,
    say HEX 1.5555 IO R!  to set default direction (out)
         DATA R@ D.  to display output register.
    Note we're still in HEX, don't forget to say DECIMAL
    before issuing any IDE functions like HOOK.
11. Say  0. DATA R!  which should drive all D pins to
    ground.  Check that all the pins with signals that
    originate from the d bus are coming out of the level
    shifter at ground, and if not buzz back to find the
    reason.  Assuming that is all grokked and fixed if
    necessary, proceed: 
12. Say  1. DATA R!  to drive d00 high.  With voltmeter,
    start at J30 pin 0.  That's d00 which should be 1.8V
    follow to U13.A3, to U13.B3 which should be high at
    the 3.3V-ish rail, to motor driver pin BI1A and pro-
    duce appropriate 5V signals on its A pins per your
    drawing.  Switch back and forth if desired, storing
    1. and 0. into UP.  Notice if any other motor driver
    input or output pins change when doing this.
13. Repeat 12 using 0. and 2. for values stored to DATA.
14. Say  DECIMAL 0 10009 HOOK and repeat relevant steps
    from above starting at 6 and using proper pins for
    the d00 and d01 signals.
